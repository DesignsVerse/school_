    <h2>6. Learn from Failures</h2>
    <p>Failure is a part of learning. Instead of fearing it, use mistakes as stepping stones to improvement. Analyze what went wrong, make corrections, and move forward.</p>

    <h2>7. Surround Yourself with Positive People</h2>
    <p>Be around friends and mentors who support and encourage you. Positive people uplift your confidence and help you believe in yourself.</p>

    <h2>8. Prepare and Practice</h2>
